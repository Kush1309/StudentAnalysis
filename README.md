# Student Exam Score Predictor 🎯📈

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Student Exam Score Predictor** is a Python-based machine learning project that predicts a student's exam score based on factors such as study hours, previous scores, attendance, or other academic parameters.

This project is ideal for **students and beginners** who want to learn the basics of **Machine Learning**, **data analysis**, and **prediction models** using Python.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Python 3**
* **NumPy**
* **Pandas**
* **Matplotlib / Seaborn** (for visualization)
* **Scikit-learn** (ML model)

---

## 📂 Features

* Load and preprocess student exam data
* Analyze relationships between study habits and scores
* Train a machine learning model
* Predict exam scores for new input data
* Visualize actual vs predicted scores
